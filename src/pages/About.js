        The quality of products found in software solutions varies greatly.
        Advancement of these solutions and the connection it creates between
        developer and client is what drove my desire to become a back-end
        developer. After graduating from ASU with a B.A. in Global Studies, I
        worked at my familyâ€™s business in social media and marketing, and then
        as policy administrator at a regional insurance company. After a few
        years, I decided to move to South Korea to teach English and leave a
        mark on the world by advancing the lifelong opportunities of children.
        This experience sparked my desire for a global career that would connect
        people and cultivate accessible, quality products and solutions. Thus
        began my deep dive into coding. Recently, I have been certified as a
        Full-Stack Developer by University of Arizona, where I gained knowledge
        in React, JavaScript, Node, SQL, and MongoDB. This arsenal of technical
        skills ties together strongly with my previous experiences.
